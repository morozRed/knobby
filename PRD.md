# PRD — **Knobby**

### A tactile app for idle hands

---

## 1. Product Summary

**Knobby** is a minimalist iOS app that provides a **sensory wall of tactile objects** — switches, knobs, sliders, and pressure surfaces — designed to give users something steady to interact with when their brain feels noisy.

Knobby has:

* no goals
* no progress
* no tracking
* no coaching
* no outcomes

It is not a wellness program or mental health tool.
It is a **digital object**.

---

## 2. Product Principle (Non-Negotiable)

> **Knobby does nothing useful — and that’s the point.**

* No productivity framing
* No emotional claims
* No optimization
* No encouragement

If the app ever *asks* something of the user, it’s broken.

---

## 3. Target User

### Primary User

* Overstimulated
* Restless hands
* Low tolerance for noise, clutter, or “motivational” UX
* Often opens apps without knowing what they want to do

They may:

* fidget
* doomscroll
* pace
* tap randomly

They are **not** looking for improvement — just relief from excess input.

### Explicitly Not Targeting

* People seeking therapy
* Habit builders
* Meditation users
* Productivity optimizers

---

## 4. Core User Promise

> “When my hands need something steady, Knobby is there.”

Not:

* “I feel better”
* “I calmed down”
* “I focused”

Just:

* “This helped me stop scrolling for a minute.”

---

## 5. Core Experience

### App Open → Touch → Close

* No home screen
* No menu
* No onboarding flow

On launch, the user is immediately presented with the **sensory wall**.

---

## 6. Sensory Wall (MVP)

### Layout

* Fixed grid
* 4–6 tactile objects visible at once
* No scrolling by default
* Predictable positions (muscle memory matters)

---

### Object Design Rules

All objects must:

* respond instantly
* have subtle resistance
* never “complete”
* never show numbers or values
* never explain themselves

State is allowed, meaning is not.

---

### MVP Objects

#### 1. Knob (Anchor Object)

* Infinite rotation
* Gentle ticking haptics
* No start, no end

This is the identity object of the app.

---

#### 2. Light Switch

* On / off / half-press
* Soft haptic thunk
* Slight visual warmth change

---

#### 3. Pressure Button

* Press and hold
* Haptics deepen over time
* Release fades slowly

---

#### 4. Weighted Slider

* Slow response
* Elastic resistance
* Center-pull feel

---

## 7. Interaction & Feedback

### Sensory Priority Order

1. Haptics
2. Micro-sound (optional, off by default)
3. Visual change

Visuals must *follow* touch, not lead it.

---

### Sound Rules

* Off by default
* No melody
* No loops
* Treated as texture, not ambience

---

## 8. First Launch UX

One sentence. Once. Then never again.

> “Touch anything. There’s nothing to finish.”

* Fades after first interaction or 5 seconds
* Never returns

---

## 9. Navigation

* No visible navigation UI
* Swipe left/right to switch walls (if unlocked)
* Long-press background for subtle environment shift
* Two-finger long press to access settings

---

## 10. Settings (Minimal)

Hidden, boring, functional.

* Haptics intensity
* Sound on/off
* Reduce motion
* Restore purchase

Nothing else.

---

## 11. Monetization

### Free Tier (Must Feel Complete)

* 1–2 fully satisfying objects
* Unlimited use
* No ads
* No timers

Free users should trust the app.

---

### Paid Tier — Unlocking More Texture

Users pay for **variety, not power**.

#### Unlocks:

* Full sensory wall
* Additional objects
* Alternate materials (rubber, metal, ceramic)
* Environmental lighting variations

No subscriptions required, but optional.

---

### Pricing

* $29.99 lifetime (primary)
* Optional:

  * $2.99/month
  * $19.99/year

Lifetime should feel like the default.

---

## 12. Paywall UX

### Rules

* Never interrupt interaction
* Never appear unprompted
* No urgency language

### Entry Points

1. Tapping a locked object (partial haptic feedback)
2. Swiping to a locked wall (blurred preview)

### Copy Example

> **Unlock the full wall**
> • More tactile objects
> • Different materials & resistance
> • One-time purchase

Buttons:

* Unlock
* Not now

---

## 13. iOS Widget (Companion Entry Point)

### Purpose

The widget is a **portal**, not a toy.

* Tap → open directly into last-used object
* Optional multi-zone widget linking to specific objects

No in-widget interaction beyond tap.

---

## 14. App Store Positioning

### Name

**Knobby**

### Subtitle

*A tactile space for idle hands*

### Description Opener

> Knobby is not a game, a tracker, or a wellness app.
> It’s just a quiet surface you can touch when scrolling feels like too much.

Footer disclaimer:

> Not a medical or therapeutic product.

---

## 15. Success Metrics (What Matters)

### Measure:

* Long-term retention (30–90 days)
* Uninstall rate (should be low)
* Lifetime purchase conversion
* Time-to-first-touch (must be near zero)

### Do NOT measure:

* session length
* daily active usage
* streaks
* emotional outcomes

---

## 16. MVP Scope (Ship This First)

1. One perfect wall
2. 3–4 tactile objects
3. Strong haptics
4. Lifetime unlock
5. One widget
6. No analytics beyond crashes

---

## 17. Risks

Knobby fails if:

* It explains itself too much
* It promises emotional outcomes
* It feels “cute” or gimmicky
* It adds goals, stats, or progress

Knobby succeeds if:

* People describe it in comments for you
* Users forget it exists — until they need it
* It feels more like an object than an app

---

## Final Note

Knobby should feel like:

> something you leave on your desk,
> not something that lives in your head.

If you want next, I can:

* Lock **Knobby** as a brand (icon, tone, type)
* Define **exact haptic curves**
* Write **App Store screenshot copy**
* Help you decide **SwiftUI architecture**

Just tell me the next step.
